Installing Word-Level QuEst:
	1 - Place all QuEst files into a folder of your choice.
	2 - Download version 3.5.1 of Stanford Core NLP from http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml
	3 - Add the file "stanford-corenlp-3.5.1-models.jar" to "quest/lib"
	4 - For spanish tagging/parsing models, download the file http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-spanish-corenlp-2015-01-08-models.jar and place it in "quest/lib"
	5 - For chinese tagging/parsing models, download the file http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-chinese-corenlp-2015-01-30-models.jar and place it in "quest/lib"
	6 - Download the Universal Wordnet plugin from http://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/uwn/uwn.zip and unzip it into a folder of your choice.
	
	Obs:
		- The Universal Wordnet plugin folder is the one which should be referenced in the variable "tools.universalwordnet.path" in the config file.
		- The tagging/parsing models for english, spanish and chinese are automatically recognized by QuEst if the aforementioned libraries are placed in the "quest/lib" folder.
		
Running Word-Level QuEst:
	1 - Create a configuration file following the example in "quest/config/config.wce.properties".
	2 - Create a feature configuration file following the example in "quest/config/features/wce_features_all.xml".
	3 - Prepare the source and target language input files for which you desire to estimate feature values. Both files must be tokenized and must have the same number of lines.
	4 - Run the following command line:
		java -cp QuEst.jar shef.mt.enes.WordLevelFeatureExtractor -lang <source_language> <target_language> -input <source_file> <target_file> -mode <selected_model> -config <config_file>
	5 - The output will be saved in the output folder specified in the configuration file under the name "output.txt". It will have M lines, one for each word in each sentence of the target language input file. Each line will have N feature values separated by a tab. It will be in the following format:
		<word_1_feature_value_1>\t<word_1_feature_value_2> ... <word_1_feature_value_n-1>\t<word_1_feature_value_n>
		<word_2_feature_value_1>\t<word_2_feature_value_2> ... <word_2_feature_value_n-1>\t<word_2_feature_value_n>
		...
		<word_m-1_feature_value_1>\t<word_m-1_feature_value_2> ... <word_m-1_feature_value_n-1>\t<word_m-1_feature_value_n>
		<word_m_feature_value_1>\t<word_m_feature_value_2> ... <word_m_feature_value_n-1>\t<word_m_feature_value_n>

Creating a Configuration File:
	1 - Create a plain text file in the folder of your choice
	2 - Assign values to parameters in the following format, one per line:
		<parameter> = <value>
	
	Parameter descriptions:
		features.default:
			- Standard mode to be used (a mode is defined by a specific selection of features).
		sourceLang.default:
			- Source language (english, spanish, chinese, german).
		targetLang.default:
			- Target language (english, spanish, chinese, german).
		
		output:
			- Folder in which to save the file with feature values.
		input:
			- Folder from which to read input files.
		resourcesPath:
			- Path to the folder in which linguistic resources are stored.
		featureConfig.<identifier>:
			- Path to a feature configuration file to be used in mode "<identifier>".
			- The user can define many distinct modes, which can be selected in the command line while running QuEst through the "-mode" parameter.
		
		<source_language>.corpus:
			- Path to a corpus for <source_language>
		<source_language>.POSModel:
			- Path to a POS tagging model for <source_language> (it can be either an absolute path to a model trained with Stanford Core NLP, or a classpath from a library in "quest/lib")
		<source_language>.parseModel:
			- Path to a parsing model for <source_language> (it can be either an absolute path to a model trained with Stanford Core NLP, or a classpath from a library in "quest/lib")
		<source_language>.lm:
			- Path to a language model for <source_language>.
			- It must be in ARPA format.
			- If left blank, QuEst will try to call your SRILM installation to automatically generate the file and place it into "<resourcesPath>/<source_language>/<source_language>.lm".
		<source_language>.ngram:
			- Path to an ngram counts file for <source_language>.
			- To produce it manually, call SRILM's "ngram-count" binary with the "-write" option, and pass the resulting file to QuEst's the shef.mt.util.NGramSorter application.
			- If left blank, QuEst will try to call your SRILM installation to automatically generate the file and place it into "<resourcesPath>/<source_language>/<source_language>_ngram.ngram.clean".
		<source_language>.stopwords:
			- Path to a file of stop words for <source_language>.
		<source_language>.translationProbs:
			- Translation probabilities between words in source and target languages.
			- The file must be produced by fast_align through the following command:
				fast_align -i <parallel_data> -v -d -o <translation_probabilities>
				
		<target_language>.corpus:
			- Path to a corpus for <source_language>
		<target_language>.POSModel:
			- Path to a POS tagging model for <source_language> (it can be either an absolute path to a model trained with Stanford Core NLP, or a classpath from a library in "quest/lib")
		<target_language>.parseModel:
			- Path to a parsing model for <source_language> (it can be either an absolute path to a model trained with Stanford Core NLP, or a classpath from a library in "quest/lib")
		<target_language>.lm:
			- Path to a language model for <source_language>.
			- It must be in ARPA format.
			- If left blank, QuEst will try to call your SRILM installation to automatically generate the file and place it into "<resourcesPath>/<source_language>/<source_language>.lm".
		<target_language>.ngram:
			- Path to an ngram counts file for <source_language>.
			- To produce it manually, call SRILM's "ngram-count" binary with the "-write" option, and pass the resulting file to QuEst's the shef.mt.util.NGramSorter application.
			- If left blank, QuEst will try to call your SRILM installation to automatically generate the file and place it into "<resourcesPath>/<source_language>/<source_language>_ngram.ngram.clean".
		<target_language>.stopwords:
			- Path to a file of stop words for <source_language>.
		<target_language>.refTranslations:
			- Path to a file containing reference translations in the target language.
			- The file must have the same number of lines as the target input file, and must contain one reference translation per line.
			
		alignments.file:
			- Path to a file of alignments between the input source and target files.
			- It must be in PHARAOH format, and can be produced by fast_align (https://github.com/clab/fast_align).
			- It can contain 1 to many alignments (1 source word to N target words), but not many to 1 alignments (1 target word to N source words).
			- If left blank, QuEst will try to call your fast_align installation to automatically generate the file and place it into "<resourcesPath>/source_to_target.out"
			
		tools.fast_align.path:
			- Path to the root folder of your fast_align installation.
		tools.ngram.path:
			- Path to the binaries folder of your SRILM installation (tipically "srilm/bin/<operational_system>").
		tools.universalwordnet.path:
			- Path to the Universal Wordnet plugin folder (must contain files "uwn.plg" and "uwn.dat").
		ngramsize:
			- Ngram size of language models and ngram count files.
			
		Obs:
			- If you provide a valid path in "tools.ngram.path", QuEst can reliably produce <source_language>.lm, <source_language>.ngram, <target_language>.lm and <target_language>.ngram automatically.
			- We do not recommend to leave the "alignments.file" parameter blank for large experiments, since QuEst will try to produce the alignments automatically, and fast_align frequently crashes when called from Java in both Windows and Unix environments.
			- We recommend for you to create separate configuration files for Word-Level QuEst and Sentence-Level QuEst.
